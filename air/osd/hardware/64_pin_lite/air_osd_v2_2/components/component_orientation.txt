Quantracker Air OSD V2.2 Component orientation for Pick and Place.

*Units*
  - The units of position in the Placement File are inches
  - The units of rotation are degrees

*Rotations for top and bottom layer components.*
	- A positive rotation of a component is assumed to be counterclockwise when looking down onto the top surface of the PCB, whether the component is on the Top or Bottom layer.

*Component Origin for measurements*
   - All components in this PCB are basically symmetrical and rectangular. The component origin is measured around the mean centre position of their nearest enclosing rectangle

*Component X Y Positions*
   - All components X and Y positions are measured looking down onto the top surface of the PCB, irrespective of whether the component is on the Top or Bottom layer.
   - X increases to the right and Y increases down.
   - The Fiducials FID1 (Front) and FID4 (Back) are placed at X = 0 , Y = 0
   
*Component Zero Rotations Orientation*
	The Component Zero rotations Orientation in ~./components/placement_bom.csv ( for components on the Top layer) have been calculated to conform
	functionally to IPC-7351 Feb 2005 Section 16. Bottom layer components orientations are as if a component on the Top was rotated 180 degrees around the X axis

	*Top Layer Components*

		*All SMD 2 terminal non-polarised Capacitors, Resistors and Inductors* 
	   	- Both pins have equal Y position.

      *All Diode and LED Footprints*
	    	- Both pins have equal Y position.
       	- Cathode Pin(terminal 1 in schematic) is on the left.
   
		*All IC's*
			- Pin 1 on upper left.
 
 	*Bottom Layer Components*
 
 		*All SMD non-polarised Capacitors, Resistors and Inductors* 
			- Both pins have equal Y position.
 
 		*All diode and LED footprints*
   		- Both pins have equal Y position.
   		- Cathode Pin is on the left.
 
 		*All IC's* 
  			- Pin 1 on Lower Left.
