The Quantracker Air OSD V2.2 files in this zip file are also available at https://github.com/kwikius/quantracker/tree/devel/air/osd/hardware/64_pin_lite/air_osd_v2_2/

*components/*
   contains "placement_bom.csv", the component placement BOM and  "component_orientation.txt", a specification of the component orientation . 
   
   	If the component orientation specification and  the resulting placement BOM is unsatisfactory, I will be happy to redo it
   	using an alternative transform for the components if you wish.
   	
      In the placement BOM, I have left the part numbers for the chip resistors and capacitors blank since you may prefer to use your own stock, however 
      I can provide some part numbers if this is more convenient. I can also provide more detailed component information if required.

*pcb/*
   contains The Gerber and Drill files.
   	The Gerber files are available in Gerber, Pdf and Postscript formats in the gerber/ subdirectory
  	   The pdf_gerbers/ and postscript_gerbers/ subdirectories contain mirrored and un-mirrored versions of the bottom layer Gerber files as pdf's and postscript format for viewing.
  	   gerbers-README.xls contains some information to help identify the layers the Gerber files represent and the suggested layup.
   
*schematic/*
   contains the schematics for the project in Pdf and Postscript formats. The kicad_project/osd.sch file can be navigated using KiCAD EESchema if preferred.
