2 x board

Tx
io
do we want expansion ports
Can be useful. Breakout unused io
make an add on board for 5V and 12V supplies. The basic board needs 5v in.
This can be supplied by add on board.
Same board for TX and rx or not

RX.
Try to incorporate OSD with tracker using same cpu?
If so need to mod tracker pins then
Or just data?
If OSD then need to have something when no data.
eg alternate that does timing and outputs an info screen.
If have RC telem then can fly on instruments maybe with basic screen
