row_count TIM1
   inited in vsync irq
   clocked by hsync pin
   one shot  stops  a bit after last row done
   compare cha for first row -> interrupt for starting column_gate
   compare cha for last row -> interrupt for stopping col gate
   poss compare ch for teletext start/end

column_gate TIM2
   master clock to gate pixel_clock
   enabled between row_count first row and last row ( sort in IRQ)
   trigger_in from hsync causes reinit ( or from row_count clk?
   internal clock
   one shot
   
pixel_clock TIM3 triggered in gated mode from column_gate(TIM2)
   Gated mode trigger_in from column_gate pwm output compare pulse ( CR2.MMS.Compare OC1)
   
internal trigger from ITR connect ITR in slave to source in SMCR.TS
    select what happens to slave on internal trigger input in SMCR.SMS
Master timer as trigger
    
    
1)Reset mode - Rising edge of the selected trigger input (TRGI) reinitializes the counter
and generates an update of the registers
2) Gated mode - The counter clock is enabled when the trigger input (TRGI) is high. The
counter stops (but is not reset) as soon as the trigger becomes low. Counter starts and
stops are both controlled
3) Trigger mode - The counter starts on a rising edge of the trigger TRGI (but it is not
reset). Only the start of the counter is controlled
4) External clock mode 1 - Rising edges of the selected trigger (TRGI) clock the counter
Note: The Gated mode must not be used if TI1F_ED is selected as the trigger input.
