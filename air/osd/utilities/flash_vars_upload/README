README for flash_vars.exe

This app can be used to upload a file of flash variables to the OSD
There should be a sample file called osd_params.txt in this directory.
in the file empty lines and lines starting with '#' should be ignored

sample invocation:
# ./flash_vars.exe -write osd_params.txt -port /dev/ttyUSB0

Until its automated, you can create a flash vars file by capturing the output of the 'show' command

Issues. 
Check that the OSD is on and connected in flash menu mode. 
**If it isnt this app doesnt notice** So do look at the output
You can tell if its working by the text or lack of returned by the OSD.
