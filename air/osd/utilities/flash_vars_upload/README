README for flash_vars.exe

This app can be used to read to :

   *  Write the flash variables to the OSD from a file
   *  Read  the flash variables to a file from the OSD. The file can then be used to
      write the Flash on other boards
   
There should be a sample file called osd_params.txt in this directory.
in the file empty lines and lines starting with '#' should be ignored

sample read invocation:
# ./flash_vars.exe -read osd_params.txt -port /dev/ttyUSB0

sample write invocation:
# ./flash_vars.exe -write osd_params.txt -port /dev/ttyUSB0

Changelog

Can now read from flash variables to a file

Fixed vector values can now contain whitespace
  e.g [ 1 ,2 , 3 ] is accepted

Fixed so that accepts return and linefeed as end of line char
Now automatically exits to start OSD when done. (Hope eventually to do it interactively
, so its wysiwyg)

Issues. 
- Check that the OSD is on and connected in flash menu mode. 
**If it isnt this app doesnt notice** So do look at the output
You can tell if its working by the text or lack of returned by the OSD.

- The array values shouldnt contain spaces else will fail,
 e.g [1,2,3] not [ 1 ,2 , 3 ] (Hope to fix this at some stage)
