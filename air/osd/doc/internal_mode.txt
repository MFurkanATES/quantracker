orig osd board
PC11 is SPI3_MISO (nwhite mask) . white spi is not active in internal. white also connected to PC6 TIM3_CH1
PC2 is SPI2_MISO (nblack level)
see /quantracker/air/osd/video/internal_video_mode.cpp

in internal mode

tim3 (called video_rows_line_counter) is used to create sync. 
To do that the 4 osd colours are remapped.

1 colour is sync tip, one black, one white

The sync tip is invoked from the timer.
PC6 ( av_telem_tx is used connected to same video mux input as white pix in ext mode ( white px is input in internal mode)
PC6 is written as a timer output for tim3 to create the csync TIM3_CH1.

The black spi is used to create black and white levels on the video line

values used are
nwhite nblack

//external mode
//   nblack nwhite adg704_addr  colour_out
//    0       0    0             grey
//    0       1    1             black
//    1       0    2             white  
//    1       1    3             video
// in internal mode
// nwhite is always 0
//   nblack nwhite adg704_addr  int colour_out  (ext colour_out
//    0       0     0           black           grey
//    0       1     0           black           black
//    1       0     2           white           white
//    1       1     2           white           transparent

In aerflite 

PA6 is used as line counter input (for tim3 video_rows_line_counter TIM3_CH1 video_in_tim3_hsync_pin) 
in ext mode and csync out in internal mode. In internal mode SPI2 black spi not used for telem or osd
data output

ext mode
mask  level   colour
    0    0     white
    0    1     black
    1    0     transparent
    1    1     transparent

int mode
  mask  level   colour
    0    0     white
    0    1     black
    1    0     csync
    1    1     csync

tim3 is still used
To select internal video mode, 
Make SPI2_MISO (mask) input 
pull PB2/BOOT1 high which pulls the video input to the mux to ground 
( may need to change the 68 ohm resistor to a link).
This also opens the analog switch to allow PA6 to be an output to use as csynch (TIM3_CH1)To turn on csync write a 1 on mask else keep at 0

SPI3_MISO (level) is used for black and white data levels. 1 is black and 0 is white. Only white is useful here so prewrite all buffer to 1
then write white. Can writing be same as external mode? Can telem be same?
Level of SPI3_MISO when not running? ( should be black level == 1, try using internal pullup)

TIM3 is set as a counter
state is kept of current line number or what part in vsync
starts as just before the vsync sequence
TODO check correct pulse output for aerflite. Should be a positive sync pulse
Each interrupt is at start of pulse
The end of the sync pulse sends a trigger output to start the gate timer for processing each osd line

During Internal video mode, the sync_sep irq is running lloking for external video
