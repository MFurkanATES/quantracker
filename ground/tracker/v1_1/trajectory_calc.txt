At time t+dt be pointing bearing p_target(t + dt) degrees and rotating at v_target(t + dt) rad_s

if dt <=0 error

let v_actual(t) be current rotational velocity
let p_actual(t) be current position

We calculate an intermediate v_desired(t + dt/2) 

where dP = p_target(t+dt) - p_actual(t)

Vdesired(t + dt/2) = 2 * dP / dt  - (v_actual(t) + v_target(t+1)) / 2

This is computed by looking at the area under the graph of V / dt between the points V_actual(t), v_desired(t+dt/2) , v_target(t + dt)
which represents the distance to be covered
