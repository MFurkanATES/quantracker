If you get errors from the quan library (GitHub/kwikius/quan-trunk ) then try downloading the current master branch.
Though this librray is relatively stable, I am still working on it so some projects will need the latest version.

If you get error messages from the baord  when writing in the flash menu. It may be due to an old version of the libraries
Currently the libraries amake files are in air/osd/ dir so object files dont all get remade for different flags etc.
Also After building a particular library, do 'make clean' or rm *.o to remove any object files which may cause a problem.
TODO move all this stuff out of there!

If set up as transmitter or receiver then OSD hangs if you dont
add receive_telemetry_task etc. A common issue with freertos where Semaphores are called without being inialised
also need local rx_telemtry stuff. Overall needs thought as to how it should work.
maybe should be folded into draw_task. Anyway needs documentation. Probably should be C++ classes.
TODO looh at mbed rtos and see if an be made compat. Unfortunately the stm32 standard libraries are quite slow
though
