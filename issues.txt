If you get error messages from the baord  when writing in the flash menu. It may be due to an old version of the libraries
Currently the libraries amake files are in air/osd/ dir so object files dont all get remade for different flags etc.
Also After building a particular library, do 'make clean' or rm *.o to remove any object files which may cause a problem.
TODO move all this stuff out of there!

If set up as transmitter or receiver then OSD hangs if you dont
add receive_telemetry_task etc. A common issue with frertos where Semaphores are called without being inialised
also need local rx_telemtry stuff. Overall needs thought as to how it should work.
maybe should be folded into draw_task. Anyway needs documentation. Probably should be C++ classes.
TODO loo at mber rtos and see if an be made compat
