If you get error messages from the baord  when writing in the flash menu. It may be due to an old version of the libraries
Currently the libraries amake files are in air/osd/ dir. Also After building a particulat library, do make clean to remove any objcet files which may cause a problem.
TODO move all this stuff out of there!

If set up as transmitter or receiver then hangs if you dont
add receive_telemetry_task etc. A common issue with frertos where Semaphores are called without being inialised
also need local rx_telemtry stuff. Overall needs thought as to how it should work.
maybe should be folded into draw_task. Anyway needs documentation.
