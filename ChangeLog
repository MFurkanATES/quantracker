   I have moved the code and Makefile for the ground part of the tracker into the subdirectory ground/tracker/v1/
   as a prelude to moving all the other associated github projects into subdirectories of this project
   so that there will only be one Github project active.

   Changed to using the gcc_arm_embedded arm gcc compiler toolchain from the Michael Pratt one. 
   Though the resulting binary image is much larger than previously, I hope that is down to inexperience. 
   There are other link options, for example, a "nano" version of newlib, which I havent yet tested.
