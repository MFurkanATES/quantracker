(currently on devel branch)
added OSD Example in quantracker/examples/osd_example1
quan/air/osd/Makefile now builds this example
Added customisation info to Sample-Dependencies.mk.
Now by providing a list of deps in Dependencies.mk, should be able to make a custom version.
See Sample-Dependencies.mk for more details
(Hope to make a library eventually so this is a crude first step)

Also added a "make upload_sp" comand to invoke stm32flash to upload via serial port
(defaults to /dev/ttyUSB0)

   I have moved the code and Makefile for the ground part of the tracker into the subdirectory ground/tracker/v1/
   as a prelude to moving all the other associated github projects into subdirectories of this project
   so that there will only be one Github project active.

   Changed to using the gcc_arm_embedded arm gcc compiler toolchain from the Michael Pratt one. 
   Though the resulting binary image is much larger than previously, I hope that is down to inexperience. 
   There are other link options, for example, a "nano" version of newlib, which I havent yet tested.
