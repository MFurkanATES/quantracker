DIY Antenna Tracker and OSD using STM32F4 .

Ground side tracker.
   Uses a Pololu style servo motor with encoder to give continuous Azimuth rotation
   Uses a standard RC Servo for elevation.
Airborne side 
   uses an OSD with telemetry via the video to send telemetry data to the tracker.
   or an Arduino ( basic option if you have a FrSky Telemetry RC system)

see my website http://www.zoomworks.org/fpv/quantracker/doc/index.html for more info about the project.

See the Changelog file in this directory for changes after 16/07/2013

         TODO May need some file dir renaming to get the directories right for compiling
      

Once these are installed you will need to modify the paths in the Makefiles to suit your configuration.

The ground tracker relies on some means on the aircraft to get the telemetry back to the tracker

The OSD can however be built as stand alone item. There are currenetly 2 customised example OSD,s in the quantracker/examples directory.
airborne option to send the data to the tracker from the aircraft.

So far there are several airborne options

  1) Use the OSD airborne module which uses the Video link direct to send telemetry.
     This is currently in development but the design is all open source and in the repo.
     I hope to have a retail version soon.

  2) using an Arduino Pro Mini microcontroller and an FrSky Rx ( simple cheap)

     a) Use an Frsky Telemetry receiver and an Ardupilot to acquire the GPS data.
      The source code for this option can be downloaded from

         https://github.com/kwikius/mavlink_to_frsky

     b) Use a GPS module attached direct to the Arduino and sending data down the FrSky telemetry link
      The source code for this option is available at
