DIY Antenna Tracker using an STM32F4 discovery board.

Uses a Pololu style servo motor with encoder to give continuous Azimuth rotation
Uses a standard RC Servo for elevation.

see my website http://www.zoomworks.org/fpv/antenna_tracker/index.html for more info about the project.

See the Changelog file in this directory for changes after 16/07/2013

Dependencies

   The GNU gcc compiler. The source code is written in C++11, requires gcc4.7  higher to compile
   You can get a suitable gcc compiler for your platform from

         https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded

   The STM32F4 standard peripherals library
   available from

         http://www.st.com/st-web-ui/static/active/en/st_prod_software_internet/resource/technical/software/firmware/stm32f4_dsp_stdperiph_lib.zip
      
   My quan library 
   available from
         
         https://github.com/kwikius/quan-trunk


Once these are installed you will need to modify the paths in Makefile to suit your configuration.

-----

You will also need an airborne option to send the data to the tracker from the aircraft.

   So far there are 2 airborne options using Arduino Pro Mini microcontroller

   1)
      Use an Frsky Telemetry receiver and an Ardupilot to acquire the GPS data.
      The source code for this option can be downloaded from

         https://github.com/kwikius/mavlink_to_frsky

   2)
      GPS module attached direct to the Arduino and sending data down the FrSky telemetry link
      The source code for this option is available at
         
         https://github.com/kwikius/quantracker_air

   There are various other applications associated with the project. 

      See https://github.com/kwikius?tab=repositories for more details
