=========================================
Uploading firmware to the Tracker and OSD 
=========================================

There are 2 methods of uploading the Tracker and OSD firmwares

*  `Using the serial port`_  is the the recommended  method for the OSD,
   though the OSD board also breaks out the SW-DP Jtag debug pins, 
   and can be programmed/debugged via the SW-DP port, `Using ST-Link`_ , if required
  	
*  `Using ST-Link`_ is the recommended for the Tracker since it incorporates a ST-Link programmer.
