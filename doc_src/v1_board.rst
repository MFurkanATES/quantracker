The Quantracker Air OSD V1 board
--------------------------------

The V1 board is not recommended to use except as a test board. 
We would recommended the V2.1 at the moment.
The V1 board had major issues with jamming GPS. 
Passing a frequency scanner over it there was found to be a large spike
at 1575 MHz which is the GPS frequency,
therefore the V1 board is not considered flyable.
However here, for completeness, is the serial port pinout for connecting MAVLink and uploading firmware

and here is the pinout of the board itself
