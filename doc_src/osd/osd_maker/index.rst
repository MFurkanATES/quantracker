---------------------
Quantracker OSD_maker
---------------------

This App can be used to create custom OSD displays 
from the Quantracker Air OSD board.

The App can import, create and modify Bitmaps and Fonts 
and convert them into source code which can be linked in 
to provide highly customisable resources for your Application.

To provide easy access to Fonts and bitmaps, the App stores them 
as png files, so as well as being modifiable within osd_maker, they can also be
manipulated in your favourite bitmap editor

As well as manipulating raw resources, the App can be used to
show a very accurate mock up of the display as it will appear on the OSD.
